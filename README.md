# Modified DES Algorithm
# Problem Statement

Use the DES algorithm but modify it to run with fewer rounds (e.g., 4, 8, 12) and more than the standard 16 rounds (e.g., 20, 24)

- Measure and record the encryption and decryption time for each configuration.
- Analyze the avalanche effect by examining how much the ciphertext changes when the plaintext or key is slightly altered.
